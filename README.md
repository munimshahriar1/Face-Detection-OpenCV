# Face-Detection-OpenCV
A simple script that allows the native machine webcam to look for trained images. 

You can train your particular image by placing the relevant image inside the "./src/training_images" folder.

Use the .bat file to run the script on Windows Powershell.

Use 'q' or 'Q' to terminate the script.

!!! Important:
- Make sure you use .jpg image file type.
- Make sure you use relevant name for the image file.
